# CaesarCipher
A Simple Implementation of a Caesar Cipher in Ruby

Run it from the command line using the command:
ruby CaesarCipher.rb

The program asks the user for the string to encrypt, and then for the integer to use as a key for the encryption, and prints the encrypted result, and then decrypts the encrypted result and prints both back to the terminal.
